# Java Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of practical Java programming projects designed to strengthen my understanding of core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and enhance problem-solving skills.

## Overview

Each project offers hands-on experience with different areas of Java development, including:

- **Exercises** – Topic-specific coding problems aimed at reinforcing fundamental Java skills such as loops, conditionals, data types, and OOP basics.
- **Hands-On Activities** – Guided tasks and mini-projects sourced from coursework or independent study that apply Java concepts in real-world scenarios.
- **Java Lessons 1 to 5** – Organized examples, notes, and code snippets covering foundational topics from early Java lessons, including:
  - Basic syntax and structure
  - Classes and objects
  - Inheritance and polymorphism
  - Control flow
  - Input/output operations
