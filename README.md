This repository contains a collection of practical Java programming projects designed to strengthen my understanding of core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and enhance problem-solving skills. Each project focuses on different aspects of Java development, offering hands-on experience with:

- **Exercises** – Topic-specific coding problems to reinforce core Java skills  
- **Hands On Activities** – Guided tasks and mini-projects from coursework or self-study  
- **Java Lesson 1 to 5** – Organized examples and notes from the first five lessons, covering foundational topics
